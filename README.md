This is an exercise tutorial on "Authorization With Pundit" from envatotuts.
See [link](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/authorization-with-pundit--cms-28202) to the tutorial.

Pundit is a tool that allows you to restrict certain parts of your Rails application to authorized users. It does this by providing you with certain helpers.

In this tutorial, you will build a blog that restricts parts such as creating, updating and deleting articles to authorized users only.
